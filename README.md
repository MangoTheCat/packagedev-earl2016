# Package Development in R

> EARL 2016

This repository has all of the code generated during the EARL 2016 workshop on package development. You can either download as a zip file or clone the repository using git.

Some of the commands that only went to the console have been added to console.R with some extra notes about using package dependencies.

Some extra content has been added after the end of the course. The git commit history should tell you what these things were.
